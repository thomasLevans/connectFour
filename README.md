What was originally a boring Java applet is now  JS web app done with d3.js and require.js

This project was inspired by a final course project I have done in the last year.  I took what was a java applet and
recoded it using javascript.  My goal in doing so was to teach myself how to utilize d3.js, require.js, and node-static.
This has been an evolving piece over this summer.  For future goals I would like to really refine the visual, as well as
integrate the web audio api and backbone.js into the structure.
